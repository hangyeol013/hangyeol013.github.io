This post is the eighth part (LSTM) of summary of a survey paper
[A state-of-the Art survey on Deep learning theory and architecture](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/8/3/292).  

The following two materials were also referred to supplement the contents:  
Book - Deep Learning (written by Ian Goodfellow)  
[A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00019.pdf)  
The main objective of this work is to provide an overall idea on deep learning and its related fields.

- Usually RNNs are networks that consist of standard recurrent cells such as sigma cells and tanh cells.  
- Figure1 shows a schematic of the standard recurrent sigma cell.  
- The mathematical expressions of the standard recurrent sigma cell are written as follows:

- Standard recurrent cells have achieved some success in some problems.  
- However, the recurrent networks that consist of standard recurrent cells are not capable of handling long-term dependencies: as the gap between the related inputs grows, it is difficult to learn the connection information.  
- Researchers analyzed fundamental reasons for the long-term dependencies problem: error signals flowing backward in time tend to either blow up or vanish.  



**LSTM**  
- In order to deal with the problem of "long-term dependencies", Hochreiter and Schmidhuber proposed the LSTM cell (1997).  
- They improved the remembering capacity of the standard recurrent cell by introducing a 'gate' into the cell.  
- Since this pione
